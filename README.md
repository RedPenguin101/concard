# Concard
Concard is a knowledge organisation system. It takes inspiration from flashcards, wikis, and from the Feynman techinique.

Learning about something is pretty easy: you read the material, write some notes, struggle with concepts and examples until you have some level of understanding. The challenge is always in learning in a way that gives you deep understanding, in a way that, six months after the initial effort, you can explain the concepts concisely and clearly to someone who doesn't know much about it, and bring that knowledge to bear on areas that may be tangentially related.

People use many ideas and techniques to get to this level of understanding. For example using the Feynman technique you try to explain the idea to someone who doesn't already understand it, the implication being that organising the knowledge in your head until you are able to do this is the core of understanding. People use flashcards to test their knowledge in small discrete ways. People review the notes they have written. People quiz themselves.

Concard is an attempt to combine as many of these practices as possible into single application. A single card is a small (500 character) summary of an idea or concept - think of it as an index card. The 500 character limit is to encourage extreme brevity: anything that is not entirely crucial to communicating the idea is left out, or more likely included on a child card. 

Each card has a title, in the form of a 'who, what, when, where, why' statement, which the body of the card then answers

## intended features
* tiered system of knowledge, with abstract drill down to concrete
* sort of a mashup of flashcards and notes
* easily reviewable / navigable with links
* each thing should be 500 chars max
* each thing should have a parent
* each thing should have tags
* somehow able to make quizes out of them
* references to places in books or articles, e.g. card on DIP would reference Clean Arch book chapter

## Inspirations
* Aphorisms, the unzip nature of them
* The Feynman technique
* User stories, brevity
* Flashcards
* Wiki's
